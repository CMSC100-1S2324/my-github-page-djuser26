What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
  -one of my key takeaways from this exercise is experimenting and exploring html and css is actually one of the most fun and best way to learn making a website especially if you are still a beginner.
  I experience a lot of trial and error but surprisingly it was more enjoyable that way.
  -another takeway is that organization is really importang in making a website. This is one area that I really want to master especially in how to manipulate flexbox in more complex formats.
